# Machine Learning with Stanford University

#### Author: Tackhyun Jung

#### Status: Completed

This repository is created to keep track of [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) provided by Coursera. This educational program is developed by Stanford University and designed to learn machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. 

In this course, I learned how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
